Karuna Ji,

We have checked our data and found the following:

Jyoti Ji: Used Asha Ji's referral link, which is why she is not showing on your dashboard.
Prem Ji: Registered using an independent link, not your referral link.
Akshaya Ji: Used Puspalata Ji's referral link.
Hemlatha Ji: Verified under the name "Hlrockz."
Kenny: Verified under the name "Om Shanti."
Venkatesh Ji: Has two WhatsApp numbers and registered with a different number, which is why he appears as pending on your dashboard. However, we have manually added Venkatesh Ji's points to your dashboard in our system.
Hope this clarifies! Let us know if you have further questions.


Karuna Ji, We will add Prem Samtani Ji's and Venkatesh Ji's points to your dashboard soon. Regarding Akshaya Ji, our records show she used Pushpalata Satapathy Ji's link on July 28, 2024. Please check with her to confirm.
