Akshaya Ji: Used Puspalata Ji's referral link.
Hemlatha Ji: Verified under the name "Hlrockz."
Kenny: Verified under the name "Om Shanti."
Venkatesh Ji: Has two WhatsApp numbers and registered with a different number, which is why he appears as pending on your dashboard. However, we have manually added Venkatesh Ji's points to your dashboard in our system.
Hope this clarifies! Let us know if you have further¬†questions.
